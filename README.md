# Geophysical-Survey-2
# Geophysical Survey and Environmental Impact Assessment  
## Nkuku 1-3 Field, Rivers State, Nigeria  

## Project Overview  
The Geophysical Survey and Environmental Impact Assessment of the Nkuku 1-3 Field in Rivers State, Nigeria, were conducted to evaluate the geological and environmental conditions of the area. This comprehensive assessment combined geophysical data collection with environmental analysis to support sustainable project planning and development.  

## Project Details  
- **Date:** November 2023  
- **Role:** Data Processor  
- **Vessel:** MC CELTIC ZION
- **Contractor**: Batoil Services Nigeria Limited
- **Client**: Homik Engineering Limited 

## Responsibilities  
-  Ensured the proper operation of survey equipment to acquire high-quality geophysical and environmental data, meeting project requirements and standards.  
-  Configured and set up navigation equipment and geophysical sensors, including conducting precise calibrations and verifications to ensure accuracy and reliability.  
-  Supervised and ensured the safe deployment and recovery of underwater sensors throughout the survey, minimizing risks to equipment and personnel.  
-   Continuously monitored equipment performance using **EIVA NaviPac** and other software tools, ensuring all sensors operated effectively and that data acquisition was seamless.  
-   Ensured that all acquired data were in the correct format, properly logged, and securely stored for analysis and reporting.  
-   Conducted regular quality checks on the incoming data to identify and resolve anomalies, ensuring the highest standards of data accuracy and completeness.
